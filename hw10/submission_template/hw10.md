I picked three data science-related jobs that look appealing. The companies are Brain Finance, Deloitte and Maya. They all provide the opportunities to collaborate with experienced data engineering specialists to work on databases and develop the analytical skills to obtain information needed. It would align to the business use cases and help customers with their needs. I think it will be helpful and interesting.
